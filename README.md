# -Node-classification

Implemented Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) following the methodology from Kipf's seminal ICLR 2017 paper, applying it to classify news topics based on their content and contextual relationships.
Independently developed a NODE2Vec model from scratch, leveraging network embeddings to capture the complex connections between news articles.
Utilized the embeddings from NODE2Vec for training a logistic regression model, effectively categorizing news topics with high precision.
Demonstrated proficiency in advanced machine learning techniques, including graph-based learning and embeddings, showcasing innovative approaches to NLP challenges in news classification.
